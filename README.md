## YouTube Lite

`YouTube Lite is a minimal, lightweight, independent client designed to provide a simplified interface for accessing publicly available YouTube content. The project focuses on performance, size reduction, and accessibility while maintaining transparency and compliance with intellectual property laws.`

### What is this?

The goal of this project is to create a small, efficient, resource-friendly YouTube client that does not rely on modifying or redistributing official Google or YouTube applications. It is built from scratch and interacts only with publicly accessible YouTube web endpoints.

***Note:*** `YouTube Lite` **is currently only for** `Android`. We are working to port YouTube Lite to other platforms.
